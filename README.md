# The code refactor project gave an already made, but slightly dysfunctional, website that we were instructed to fix and improve. Doing so required paying attention to specifically accessibility standards which meant coding in descriptions of photos used on the website to individuals who cannot see the computer screens. Along with accessbility for the users, the code was consolidated where needed in the css file and semantically organized inside index.html for future developers including comments written in both files explaining changes made.
